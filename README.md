## What I Learned
Creating **Cosmic Runner** using Pygame was a valuable learning experience. Through this project, I gained the following skills and knowledge:

1. **Game Development with Pygame:** I learned how to build 2D games using the Pygame library, from handling input events to rendering game elements.

2. **Sprite Animation:** I mastered the art of sprite animation, which is crucial for creating dynamic and visually appealing characters and obstacles.

3. **Collision Detection:** I implemented collision detection logic, a fundamental aspect of gaming, to detect interactions between the player's character and obstacles/enemies.

4. **Game State Management:** I learned how to manage different game states, such as the main menu, gameplay, and game-over screens, to provide a smooth user experience.

5. **Score Tracking:** I integrated a scoring system that tracks and displays the player's score, enhancing the competitive aspect of the game.

6. **Audio Integration:** I integrated background music and sound effects to create an immersive gaming environment.

**Cosmic Runner** not only showcases my newfound skills in Pygame but also provides an entertaining and challenging gaming experience. I'm excited to share this game with others and continue exploring the world of game development. Give it a try and see how far you can run in the cosmic universe!
